# Doom-2-expanded-project-experiment
Full Doom 2 overhaul using UDMF and GZDOOM

This is a full gameplay and visual overhaul for doom 2, designed to preserve the spirit and identity of the original game, while expanding it in a modern and technically advanced way. Original monsters, textures and weapons were maintained, and new monsters, textures and weapons were added. Despite this, the classic doom 2 feel is intentionally preserved.

The maps are based on the original doom 2 layouts, but with carefully designed expansions and localized modifications. Fans will recognize the maps immediately. Certain areas have been expanded or reworked. Some locations feature noticeable but purposeful changes. The goal is familiarity without simple copy-paste design.

This project uses the UDMF map format, allowing features that were impossible in the original doom 2 engine, such as true 3D floors, deep water, where the player can actually sink, bridges and structures that the player can walk over and under... These features are integrated naturally into gameplay, not just as visual gimmicks.

This mod is not a remake, not a remaster, and not a vanilla replacement. It is a reinterpretation of doom 2. Familiar, but not identical. Modern, but still Doom. Expanded, without losing identity... and with some extra things. If you enjoy doom 2 and want a fresh experience that still respects the original game’s essence, this project is made for you. Feel free to mod if you want.
